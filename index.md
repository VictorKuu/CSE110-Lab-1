# Welcome to Victor's User Page!

## About me 
Greetings! I'm **Victor**! I am a second year computer engineering major at UC San Diego. I think Python is the superb language. Take this question for an example
>Swap integers without additional variable

Non-python programmers may do the following: 
```
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
```

Python, however, can simply write it like `a,b = b,a`. Easy right?!

By the way, heres the link to my favorite [YouTube Video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU)
